# Background
In my job searching in the data field, i realised that the insights i am getting from just looking up job posting sites was not enough. So that is why i decided to find out what are the best paid jobs and skills in this field , using one the most popular data science tool: SQL.

 Data hails from my [SQL Course](https://www.lukebarousse.com/sql). It's packed with insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.

 ## The question i wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:
 1. What are the top-paying Data Scientist jobs in the European Union?
 2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
 3. What skills are in most demand for Data Scientists in general?
 4. What are the best paying skills in this field?
 5. What are the most optimal skills a Data Scientist should learn?
